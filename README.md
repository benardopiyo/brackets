# Brackets

`Brackets` program takes an undefined number of strings as arguments. For each argument, if the expression is correctly bracketed, the program prints "OK" followed by a newline (\n); otherwise, it prints "Error" followed by a newline.

## Symbols considered as brackets are:

* Parentheses: ( and )
* Square brackets: [ and ]
* Curly braces: { and }

Every other symbols are simply ignored. An opening bracket must always be closed by the correct closing bracket in the correct order. 

A string that does not contain any brackets is considered a correctly bracketed string.

If there are no arguments, the program must print nothing.
